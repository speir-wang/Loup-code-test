# Loup

If I spend more time on this test, I will create a mock HTTP request to fetch the data.

Also create a drill down into different recipe page.

If the individual recipe page was built, would love to include E2E tests for that as well.

Haven't worked with responsive images before, so I will take more time into that if I got more time.

The build scripts are list below, this is intialised by create-react-app with TypeScript template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
